# Workshop Status
Thanks to the coronavirus, we are converting this workshop to be 100% online.  We will update this page as we create new notebooks and are planning on having four weeks of material:
1. Intro to python
2. Working with Pandas and Data Visualization
3. Integration with Excel and SPSS and file formatting
4. Statistical packages in Python

# Google Colab
Google Colaboratory is an online host for learning python.  All of the notebooks in this workshop will be posted as a jupyter notebook in a google colab format.  As long as you're signed in to your google account, you'll be able to access/run/modify the code we'll be working with.

# Installing Anaconda
If you are planning on working with your own data, we strongly recommend downloading [anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section).  Anaconda provides a platform populated with almost everything you'll need. It has several different python editors to choose from and an easy way to install new packages.  We strongly recommend working with either jupyter lab or spyder (v 4).

### Why we like jupyter lab
Jupyter lab is very similar to the Google Colab environment and will be familiar and easy to work use.  Jupyter notebooks are a good way to break up your code into small chunks and also separate it with text.

### Why we like spyder
Spyder is great and what we use most often.  It has a traditional text editor on one side, an interactive terminal for testing your code, a file explorer, and a dedicated area for all plots/graphs.  The layout is customizable but overall very similar to R studio.
