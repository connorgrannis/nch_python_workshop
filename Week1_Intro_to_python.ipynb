        "\n",
        "A **loop** is when you write some code to do something repeatedly (sometimes with slight changes with every loop) until you reach a desired outcome. There are two main kinds of loops in Python:\n",
        "* **for loops**: a **for loop** is done *for* every item specified in the condition. They work well with lists and dictionaries to cycle though their contents individually\n",
        "  * the syntax for a **for loop** is as follows: \n",
        "  ```\n",
        "  for X in Y:\n",
        "      do something\n",
        "  ```\n",
        "  where Y is the object we iterate through (such as a list) and X is an arbitrary, temporary variable that represents the item in Y through each loop.\n",
        "  That sounds a little confusing, lets look at the code below to get a better idea of what we mean."
